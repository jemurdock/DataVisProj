Code: all code is in the js folder, plus the html files and css file.<br/>
Data: all raw data is in the data folder, while wrangled data is in the cleanData folder. We didn't use all of our data directly, so not everything in the data folder is also wrangled in the cleanData folder.<br/>
Libraries: we didn't use any libraries.<br/>
Documents: the storytelling folder has documents used for the info boxes, while the documents folder has our feedback documents and Process Book.<br/>
