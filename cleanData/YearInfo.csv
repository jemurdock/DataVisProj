2020,"In 2019, Barnes and Noble was bought by Elliot Advisors, a hedge fund known for previously buying British bookstore chain Waterstones and reviving it. However, due to shutdowns for Covid-19, over 400 of the remaining 627 stores were temporarily closed in 2020. Indie stores are still rising, and Amazon has opened a total of 21 physical bookstores so far.","E-book popularity seems to have stabilized, at least for now, and though audiobooks are still gaining, print books remain the most popular book format. In 2020, Bookshop.org launched with support from the American Booksellers Association, designed to be an alternative to Amazon to support indie bookstores. Affiliates get about double the commission that Amazon offers, while the remaining profits go to participating stores and Bookshop’s own costs.","Blurb partnered with Amazon in 2014 to make their books more available, but remains an independent company. In 2018, CreateSpace was merged into Amazon’s KDP and no longer exists, while Barnes & Noble upgraded its own self-publishing service to replace Nook Press. While the publishing industry as a whole has remained fairly constant, self-publishing is still rising quickly, and booksellers who offer such services are getting some of those rewards."
